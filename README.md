# BiSET

Install the package:

devtools::install_github('Chuheming/BiSET')

Start Running the package:

BiSET：：Frame()

BiSET can generate the synthetic dataset to verify the biclustering performance according to two evaluate method, Relevance and Recovery.

# Usage
#Generate the synthetic dataset

We consider that the biclustering partten, such as shift partten, scale partten and shift-partten, could be represented by one formular:

X = alpha + Beta * Gamma

Therefore, the synthetic dataset could be generated by setting three parameters and selecting the dataset whether has noise or overlap

#Biclustering
Six classical biclustering algorihtms are collection in BiSET. They are CC, QUBIC, Bimax, rUnibic, FABIA are Plaid. 

You could select the algorithm on the checkbox When you determin to use the biclustering algorithm to analysis your dataset. Then,
click the button 'Run'. Wait moment, a prompt box will alert the result.

Finally, you can click the button 'Save_Bic' to solve the result

#GO Enrichment analysis and KEGG Analysis

This function will help you easily to get the enrichment result.
You only select the gene Symbol or ENSENBL and select the dataset specials, and also select the p-value. 
Then, click the button 'GO Analysis' or KEGG Analysis.

Similarly, you also can save the enrichment resutl when you click the button 'Save_GO'
