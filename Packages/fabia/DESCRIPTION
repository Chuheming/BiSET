Description: Biclustering by "Factor Analysis for Bicluster
        Acquisition" (FABIA). FABIA is a model-based technique for
        biclustering, that is clustering rows and columns
        simultaneously. Biclusters are found by factor analysis where
        both the factors and the loading matrix are sparse. FABIA is a
        multiplicative model that extracts linear dependencies between
        samples and feature patterns. It captures realistic
        non-Gaussian data distributions with heavy tails as observed in
        gene expression measurements. FABIA utilizes well understood
        model selection techniques like the EM algorithm and
        variational approaches and is embedded into a Bayesian
        framework. FABIA ranks biclusters according to their
        information content and separates spurious biclusters from true
        biclusters. The code is written in C.
